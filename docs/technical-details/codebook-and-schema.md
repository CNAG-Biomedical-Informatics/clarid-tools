# 📘 ClarID Codebook Documentation

## Overview

This codebook defines a standardized encoding system for species, biosample metadata, assay types, conditions, and other identifiers in the **ClarID** project. It provides a mapping between human-readable labels and compact codes or stub codes for use in structured identifiers and databases.

??? Example "See Codebook:"

    ```yaml
    --8<-- "../share/clarid-codebook.yaml"
    ```

## 📝 Metadata

Defines global codebook info:

```yaml
metadata:
  version: "0.03"         # 🏷️ official ClarID specification version
  local_version: "CNAG-GDC-v1"  # 🏷️ project-specific codebook revision (optional)
  author: "M. Rueda"      # 👤 author
  center: "CNAG"          # 🏢 institution
  date: "2026-04-01"      # 📅 YYYY-MM-DD
  description: "ClarID codebook"  # 📝 summary
  repository: "https://github.com/cnag-biomedical-informatics/clarid-tools"  # 🔗 repo URL
```

??? Note "About `version`"
    `version` identifies the official ClarID specification release targeted by the
    codebook and schema, for example `0.03`. ClarID-Tools compatibility is defined
    at this release level.

??? Tip "About `local_version`"
    `local_version` is optional and can be used for ad hoc or project-specific
    codebook variants without changing the official ClarID specification version.
    This is useful when different projects need their own controlled vocabularies,
    aliases, or dictionary updates while still conforming to the same ClarID
    release.

??? Hint "About `species`:"

    > **Reference**: Based on Schrade et al., *Animals* 2024, Table 2.


    🧬 Component I: Species Information

    Each species entry is defined by two key elements:

    - **Element 1 (positions 1–3)**: `tax_code`
      A 3-letter taxonomic classification code:
      - 1st letter: Class
      - 2nd letter: Order
      - 3rd letter: Family
      - Example: `MPC` = *Mammalia | Primates | Cercopithecidae*

    - **Element 2 (positions 5–10)**: `code`
      A 6-letter binomial acronym formed by:
      - 3 letters from the genus name
      - 3 letters from the species name
      - Example: `MacMul` = *Macaca mulatta*

    - **`stub_code`**: A 2-character Base-62 encoded unique species identifier
    (e.g. `"01"` for *Homo sapiens*, `"0E"` for *Macaca mulatta*)

    Note: `tax_code` is provided as metadata and is not used in encode/decode logic.

### 🧬 species
```yaml
    species:
      Human:
        code: HomSap        # 🆔 binomial acronym
        stub_code: "01"     # 🔢 index
        label: "Homo sapiens"  # 📖 name
        id: "NCBITaxon:9606"  # 🔗 taxonomy
        tax_code: MPH       # 🏷️ class|order|family
```

### 🏥 tissue

```yaml
    condition_pattern:
      regex: '^([A-Z]\d{2}(?:\.\d+)?)$'  # ✅ Letter+digits
      code_format: '%s'
      stub_format: '%s'
```

## 👥 Subject

### 🔄 study
Reuses `biosample.project`:

```yaml
  subject:
    study: *all_projects
```

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 type, sex, age_group
```yaml
      Case:
        code:       Case
        stub_code:  C
        label:      "Case Study"
        id:         "NCIT:C15362"
      sex:
      Male:
        code:       Male
        stub_code:  M
        label:      "Male"
        id:         "PATO:0000384"

          code:       A20_29
          stub_code:  A2
          label:      "Age 20-29"
          id:         "APOLLO:SV_00000241" # age range category

```
??? Note "Naming conventions"
    Vocabulary keys under `biosample` and `subject` (e.g. `RhesusMacaque`, `PeripheralBlood`) use CamelCase; attributes (e.g. `code`, `stub_code`, `tax_code`) use snake_case.  
    Rationale: CamelCase keeps multi-word names compact and avoids confusion with attributes.  
    **Exceptions:** some keys (e.g. `"Not Available"`, `RNA_seq`) keep original style for clarity or compatibility.
